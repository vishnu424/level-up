        <strong>Binding Arbitration; Class Action Waiver</strong>
        <p>
          At Level Up Learning's or your election, all disputes, claims, or
          controversies arising out of or relating to the Terms of Service or
          the Service that are not resolved by mutual agreement may be resolved
          by individual (not group) binding arbitration to be conducted before a
          lawyer. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, arbitration will be
          held in Tamilnadu before a single arbitrator mutually agreed upon by
          the parties, or if the parties cannot mutually agree, and will be
          conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations promulgated
          unless specifically modified in the Terms of Service. The arbitration
          must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a
          written demand for arbitration is filed by either party. The
          arbitrator’s decision and award will be made and delivered within
          sixty (60) days of the conclusion of the arbitration and within six
          (6) months of the selection of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will not
          have the power to award damages in excess of the limitation on actual
          compensatory, direct damages set forth in the Terms of Service and may
          not multiply actual damages or award punitive damages or any other
          damages that are specifically excluded under the Terms of Service, and
          each party hereby irrevocably waives any claim to such damages. The
          arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses
          (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing
          part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply
          with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and
          expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in
          enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of
          temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in
          court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate
          and irreparable harm. The provisions of this arbitration section will
          be enforceable in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notwithstanding the provisions of the introductory section above, if
          Level Up Learning changes this ‘Arbitration’ section after the date
          you first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent
          changes to these Terms of Service), you may reject any such change by
          sending us written notice within 30 days of the date such change
          became effective, as indicated in the “Date of Last Revision” date
          above or in the date of Level Up Learning' email to you notifying you
          of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you
          will arbitrate any dispute between you and Level Up Learning in
          accordance with the provisions of this section as of the date you
          first accepted these Terms of Service (or accepted any subsequent
          changes to these Terms of Service).

        <p>
          YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT THE ABOVE DISPUTE PROCEDURES SHALL BE
          YOUR SOLE REMEDY IN THE EVENT OF DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND Level Up
          Learning REGARDING ANY ASPECT OF THE SERVICE (INCLUDING THE ENROLMENT
          PROCESS) AND THAT YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHT TO LEAD OR PARTICIPATE IN

        <strong>Disputes between Users</strong>
        <p>
          You agree that you are solely responsible for your interactions with
          any other user in connection with the Service and Level Up Learning
          will have no liability or responsibility with respect thereto. Level
          Up Learning reserves the right, but has no obligation, to become
          involved in any way with disputes between you and any other user of
          the Service.

        <strong>General</strong>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between you and
          Level Up Learning and govern your use of the Service, superseding any
          prior agreements between you and Level Up Learning with respect to the
          Service. You also may be subject to additional terms and conditions
          that may apply when you use affiliate or third party services, third
          party content or third party software. These Terms of Service will be
          governed by the laws of the State of Tamilnadu without regard to its
          conflict of law provisions. With respect to any disputes or claims not
          subject to arbitration, as set forth in Section 10 above, you and
          Level Up Learning agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
          jurisdiction of the state and high courts located within Tamilnadu,
          India. The failure of Level Up Learning to exercise or enforce any
          right or provision of these Terms of Service will not constitute a
          waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of these Terms of
          Service is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid,
          the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give
          effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and
          the other provisions of these Terms of Service remain in full force
          and effect. You agree that regardless of any statute or law to the
          contrary, any claim or cause of action arising out of or related to
          use of the Service or these Terms of Service must be filed within one
          (1) year after such claim or cause of action arose or be forever
          barred. A printed version of this agreement and of any notice given in
          electronic form will be admissible in judicial or administrative
          proceedings based upon or relating to this agreement to the same
          extent and subject to the same conditions as other business documents
          and records originally generated and maintained in printed form. You
          may not assign this Terms of Service without the prior written consent
          of Level Up Learning, but Level Up Learning may assign or transfer
          this Terms of Service, in whole or in part, without restriction. The
          section titles in these Terms of Service are for convenience only and
          have no legal or contractual effect. Notices to you may be made via
          either email or regular mail. The Service may also provide notices to
          you of changes to these Terms of Service or other matters by
          displaying notices or links to notices generally on the Service.
