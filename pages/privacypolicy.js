              <p>
                We collect Personal Data from You when You voluntarily provide
                such information, such as when You contact us with inquiries,
                respond to one of our surveys, register for access to the
                Services, or use certain Services. Wherever Level Up Learning
                collects Personal Data we make an effort to provide a link to
                this Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <p>
                When You interact with Level Up Learning through the Services,
                we receive and store certain personally non-identifiable
                information. Such information, which is collected passively
                using various technologies, cannot presently be used to
                specifically identify you. Level Up Learning may store such
                information itself or such information may be included in
                databases owned and maintained by Level Up Learning affiliates,
                agents or service providers. The Services may use such
                information and pool it with other information to track, for
                example, the total number of visitors to our Site, the number of
                visitors to each page of our Site, and the domain names of our
                visitors' Internet service providers. It is important to note
                that any information collected through this process is purely
                incidental and there is no specific attempt is being made to
                collect such Personal Data in this process.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may also automatically receive and collect certain anonymous
                information in standard usage logs through the web server,
                including mobile-identification information obtained from the
                equivalent of "cookies" sent to the App, including mobile
                network information, standard web log information, traffic to
                and from our App, tracking inside the App and any other
                available information, from:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>an IP address, assigned to the device used by the User;</li>
                <li>
                  the domain server through which the User accesses the App and
                  the functions and features therein; and

                In operating the Services, we may use a technology called
                "cookies." A cookie is a piece of information that the computer
                that hosts our Services gives to your browser when You access
                the Services. Our cookies help provide additional functionality
                to the Services and help us analyze Services usage more
                accurately. For instance, our Site may set a cookie on your
                browser that allows You to access the Services without needing
                to remember and then enter a password more than once during a
                visit to the Site. In all cases in which we use cookies, we will
                not collect Personal Data except with your permission. On most
                web browsers, You will find a “help” section on the toolbar.
                Please refer to this section for information on how to receive
                notification when You are receiving a new cookie and how to turn
                cookies off. We recommend that You leave cookies turned on
                because they allow You to take advantage of some of the Service
                features. However, it is purely optional and completely at your
                discretion, depending on your use.

                In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of

                Personal Data, and other information provided to us. This
                research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate basis, and
                Level Up Learning may share this aggregate data with its
                affiliates, agents, and business partners. This aggregate
                information does not identify You personally. Level Up Learning
                may also disclose aggregated user statistics in order to
                describe our services to current and prospective business
                partners, and to other third parties for other lawful purposes.

            Data for a certain reason, we may use the Personal Data in

            affiliates may use this information to contact You in the future to
            tell You about services we believe will be of interest to you. If we
            do so, each marketing communication we send You will contain
            instructions permitting You to "opt-out" of receiving future
            marketing communications. In addition, if at any time You wish not

                providers may also use the information about your visits to

          <strong>Integrating Social Networking Services</strong>

            enable or log in to the Services via various social networking
            services like Facebook or Twitter (“Social Networking Service(s)”).
            By directly integrating these services, we make your online

            feature, we will ask You to log into or grant us permission via the
            relevant Social Networking Service. When You add a Social Networking
            Services account to the Service or log into the Service using your
            Social Networking Services account, we will collect relevant
            information necessary to enable the Service to access that Social
            Networking Service and your data contained within that Social
            Networking Service. As part of such integration, the Social
            Networking Service will provide us with access to certain
            information that You have provided to the Social Networking Service,
            and we will use, store, and disclose such information in accordance
            with this Privacy Policy. However, please remember that the manner
            in which Social Networking Services use, store, and disclose your
            information is governed by the policies of such third parties, and
            Level Up Learning shall have no liability or responsibility for the
            privacy practices or other actions of any Social Networking Services
            that may be enabled within the Service.

          <p>
            You may also have the option of posting your Services activities to
            Social Networking Services when You access content through the
            Services (for example, You may post to Facebook that You performed
            an activity on the Service); You acknowledge that if You choose to
            use this feature, your friends, followers and subscribers on any
            Social Networking Services You have enabled will be able to view
            such activity.
